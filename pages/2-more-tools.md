# more tools

This will cover some SUAPP development tools that we didn't get to cover in the first stream:

- `suave-geth spell`
  - deploying contracts (vs `forge create`)
  - sending CCRs
- `SuaveEnabled` forge tests
  - setting `confidentialInputs` in a forge test
  - using `Context` for confidential data
- alternate eth providers for suave-geth
  - anvil from [suavex-foundry](https://github.com/flashbots/suavex-foundry)
